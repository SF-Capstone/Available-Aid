# Available-Aid

# I. Introduction to *Available Aid*

## Overview

*Available Aid* aims to **reduce friction between vulnerable communities and the resources available to them**. It provides **a platform for shelters to broadcast their offerings** through an always *up-to-date* **shelter capacity tracker**. Persons seeking shelter will be able to **quickly find and navigate to the closest shelter** that meets their unique needs with an available bed.

The *Available Aid* platform will consist of **a mobile web interface utilizing the Laravel framework**.

First, the web interface shall be a volunteer-facing portal for shelter staff to track and update available beds across many shelters. This allows volunteers/staff to provide information to those seeking shelter. Eventually, the web interface should turn outward so that community members may access the information directly ( i.e. user-facing).

Information provided on the web interface should include, but is not limited to: shelters with available beds, nearby shelters, shelter restrictions and regulations, and shelter accommodations.

The goal is for users to be able to quickly gauge which shelter is the best option for them without any prerequisite tech literacy.

The *Available Aid* platform is committed to be open-sourced with a bare minimum budget for data hosting and server costs.

In situations already fraught with stress and anxiety, *Available Aid* is intended to be a **reliable**, *easy-to-use* tool, **accessible for all**.
